Hello and thank you for reviewing our project! 
First of all, as you can see, here, you have, video called "Spark In Dark Showcase", where we are in 3 minutes, explaining to you, what our project is. 
Then, I made a power point presentation and it is called: "SparkInDarkPresentation". I know that I probabbly WONT need it, but it is better to have it and not need it, then need it and do not have it. 
And finally, in folder "Spark-In-Dark" you can see all of the code for Spark In Dark. 
Please do note, that we used: HTML5, CSS3, JS, PhP and MySQL by XAMPP and that you can not simply double click on index.php to open a application itsself. You can of course view its code by right click and then edit with notepad or any other text editor. 
But in order to run it on your machine, you will need to set up your PC to act as server and databse for which, you will need to install XAMPP. 

This is all from introduction part and the rest of this ReadMe will be like Q&A for some questions, that I feel that you want to ask us. 

#What is Spark In Dark? 
--------------------------------------

Spark In Dark is a project that we managed to create in 40 hours on AngelHacks 2.0 

Here is a general description of it: 


Here is a video description of our project: https://youtu.be/gHXACTkDa-4 . 

Spark In Dark is a web application that connect people in need of an any kind of help to those good souls in our society, that want to help other in their free time for free ðŸ˜Š.  <br> <br>
Every user has option to ask for help, which can be anything from simple homework through voice call to something physical in real world. Other users, that want to help, can get in contact and try to resolve his problem and put their effort to do everything in their power to help him! After that, as thanks, helpers can get points for their work. <br>
If you do not need help, but want to help, we will be glad to have you onboard! Just make an account and then search for your field of expertise or view the newest requests, simply click add and get in contact with those in need. <br> <br>
Spark In Dark is providing you with text, voice and even video call to give you full online communication, but if problem is bigger than that, you can always meet up in real world!

Those who want to help, people in need, without receiving any credit for their work, are the truly good souls. 


#How it works? 
--------------------------------------

1.) Just simply make an account. <br> 

2.) Ask for help (Make Help Request) <br> 

3.) Search for other Help Requests and Help other people! <br> 

4.) Other people will conect with you and try to resolve your problem <br> 

5.) That is all!! <br> Now, go ahead and make this world a better place . ;) :) . 

THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT MAKE A WORLD A BETTER PLACE, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING IT DO!! 

#Is Spark In Dark done (in code) in full? 
--------------------------------------

Tehnicly, no! 
We managed to make real time, message sharing functionality, adding help requests, accepting (picking) help requests, user log in, user registration, viewing everything at dashboard and profile (account) setting. 
We created this in 40 hours and after those 40 hours, we are really tired and can not do more. We are so sorry that we letted you down, by not creating this in full. BUT, in general only this can be very usefull and we have decided to call this Spark in Dark Demo . 

We still need to make: Vocie call, Video call, Calendar for help requests and Points Shop to be ready for its 1.0 launch. 
But we have imagined some secret functionalities that we will add in future as well ;) . 

#Will we continue with this project, even, after the Angel Hacks 2021? 
--------------------------------------

Of course, YES! 
As this was a hell lot of awesome time and we have decided to continue working on this after the hackathon to add everything that is missing and hopefully publish it in near future and if it became popular, well, hows knows what is going to happened!! 

#When are we planning to publish 1.0 version of Spark In Dark? 
--------------------------------------

By all calculations, I have concluded, that 1.0 version will be live worldwide, somewhere at the beginning of May 2021. year. 

#Who is in the team? 
--------------------------------------

Myself, that is Srdjan and I am 16 years old with 4 years of web development experience and 2 years of game development. And second member is Danilo Grbic, who is my close friend and he have only a few months in web programming and that is all. 
So I have taken this chance to teach him and pass on him some of my knowladge. But I am still learning and I did learned a few new super duper things!! 

As you can see only the two of us are in team, but that did not stop us from hacking 40 hours of 48 hours - That is why we builded this much and right after I submit this, I will go to sleep ;) :) . 

Here are our, discord tags: 
1.) Srdjan: Srki#2945 . 
2.) Danilo: Danilo Grbic#3102 . 

#What did we learned? 
--------------------------------------

1.) TEAM WORK! â€‹

2.) Some advanced algorithms, such as DFS, BFS, how searching mechanics work and a few more. â€‹

3.) Color Science and How to make good color combinations. â€‹

4.) How to make, real time, message sharing functionality.  â€‹

5.) How MySQL, sometimes, can be annoying :D . 

And I have teached Danilo a little bit of PhP. 
Since he was doing 50% of frontend and about 20% of backend. 


#Why did we signed up for AngelHacks 2.0? 
--------------------------------------

Ok, as I am always trying to be honest, I will be honest this time as well. 
I was looking Pinnecle 2021 website to see which hackathon can qualify me for that awesome competition. 
And I managed to find AngelHacks 2.0, which was primarly beginner based and I thought that, here I will have the best chances to get there. 
I know that this reason is very very bad, but as I said, I just wanted to be honest. 

But this was amazing 40 hours journey, filled out with a lot of fun, jokes, coffee, laugh and "sparks" :D . So whatever happened, I will never regret spending my time on this hackathon and if I can travel back in time, I will do everything the same. 
In that spirit, I am excited and I will sign up for AngelHacks next year for sure! But this time, the reson will be, just, awesome time!!
